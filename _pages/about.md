I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from [Arizona State University (ASU)](https://www.asu.edu/). Before that, I received a M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, Davis]() , and a B.E. in Information Security from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](). My research interests are security and privacy in networked systems, including mobile security, cyber-physical systems, wireless sensing, 5G and NextG systems, and smart grid.
**Openings**: I'm looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and master students to join my group. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts.
